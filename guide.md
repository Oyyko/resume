1. 量化你的impact。Your resume needs more specific numbers. Using hard numbers to describe your achievements is important, even if you're entry-level. You don't have enough of them, so let's show you how to improve this. To improve your resume, we need to rewrite your weaker bullets by adding specific numbers. Try to quantify 4 more bullets to get a perfect score here.

Words like these lack impact as they're subjective and unsupported. While they aren't negative, they often fall flat because they are rather generic, and lack the context of concrete actions or results. Everyone thinks these things about themselves, so hiring managers don't value them.

So try to remove these phrases from your resume. Either don't mention them at all, or demonstrate these qualities through your work experience. Additionally, avoid using these types of phrases in your skills section if you have one. That section is reserved for hard skills, such as tools, software, or techniques, and not for buzzwords like the ones we found.
